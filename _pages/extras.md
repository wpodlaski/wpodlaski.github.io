I am a co-organizer of [WWNeuRise](https://neurise.github.io/), an online seminar series for early-career researchers in systems neuroscience.

From 2017-2019, I was a teaching assistant at the [IBRO-Simons Computational Neuroscience Imbizo](https://imbizo.africa/) in Cape Town, South Africa. See my [GitHub page](https://github.com/wpodlaski) for a couple of the tutorials that I taught at the course.
