Since 2019, I have been a postdoctoral researcher at the [Champalimaud Foundation](https://fchampalimaud.org/champalimaud-research) in Lisbon, Portugal, working in the lab of [Christian Machens](https://machenslab.org/). Before that, I completed my DPhil (PhD) at the University of Oxford, UK, with [Tim Vogels](https://vogelslab.org/) (now based at IST, Austria). Before that, I studied computer science at EPFL (Lausanne, Switzerland) and biology at Cornell University (Ithaca, NY, USA).
