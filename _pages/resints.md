My research interests include various topics across biological and artificial intelligence. Some specific topics are:

- Computation and representation in spiking neural networks
- Biologically-plausible deep learning
- Neural population analysis of calcium imaging and electrophysiology data
- Models of learning and memory
- Biophysical neuron models and ion channels

Stay tuned for more developments on these topics here...
