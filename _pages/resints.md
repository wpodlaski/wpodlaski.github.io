My research interests include various topics across biological and artificial intelligence. Some specific topics are:

- Computation and representation in spiking neural networks

	- [Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irxtUINGMWM) for a video explanation of my recent work on universal function approximation in balanced excitatory-inhibitory networks.

- Biologically-plausible deep learning

	- [Click here](https://slideslive.com/38936653) for a video explanation of my 2020 NeuRIPS paper.\

- Neural population analysis of calcium imaging and electrophysiology data
- Models of learning and memory
- Biophysical neuron models and ion channels

Stay tuned for more developments on these topics here...
